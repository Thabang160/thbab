          <h2>FEZEKA HIGH SCHOOL</h2>
          <p>The school was founded in 1966, during the Apartheid era after black South Africans were not permitted to live in the city and were removed 
            from areas such as District Six to Gugulethu, Nyanga and Langa. It was the second high school in the black township with Langa
            High School being first and I.D Mkize and Mabuwa (later renamed Sizamile High School and now known as Oscar Mpeta)
            In August 1976, the school was part of the Soweto Uprising which was a protest led by black students across South
            Africa against the Bantu Education Act, which forced all black schools to use Afrikaans and English as languages
            of instruction. In the 1990s the school was moved to a new location when the old high school was re-purposed (also known now as iFezeka endala).                              
            <br>The students of Fezeka come from Western Cape and its suburbs, including Guguletu, Langa, Nyanga and Khayelitsha.</p><br>
